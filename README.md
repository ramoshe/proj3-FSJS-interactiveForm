## Project Description
*From Treehouse*
In this project, you'll use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, you'll add your own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:
 - Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
 - Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

After completing this project, you'll have a solid foundational knowledge of using and customizing forms in your projects. This is tremendously valuable since forms are a major aspect of most web sites and web applications, which makes this project a key addition to your portfolio, and a crucial step on your journey to becoming a professional full stack web developer.
